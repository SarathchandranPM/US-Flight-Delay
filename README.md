## US Flight Delay Analysis Project

A comprehensive Power BI analysis of 2 million commercial flights from major US airports to identify patterns in flight delays and cancellations. The project demonstrates advanced data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization techniques to generate actionable insights.

### Technical Implementation:
- Performed ETL operations using Power Query to clean and transform flight data
- Created data model with relationships across four tables (Flights, Airlines, Airports, Cancellation Codes)
- Implemented conditional columns for flight status categorization
- Developed DAX measures for calculating delay and cancellation metrics
- Designed interactive dashboard with multiple visualization types
- Set appropriate interactions between charts
- Published the report to Power BI Service

### Key Visualizations:
- Temporal analysis of delays/cancellations using line charts
- Geographic distribution of flight volumes by city
- Airline performance comparison through clustered bar charts
- Cancellation reason breakdown via pie charts
- Day-of-week cancellation patterns
